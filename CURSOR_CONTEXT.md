- Ensure consistent styling across all browsers
- Consider caching search results to reduce API calls
- Consider adding keyboard navigation for search results
- Monitor API usage and optimize if needed

## Database/Model State
- No database is used in this application
- Data is fetched from external APIs:
  - Municipality data from OpenDataSoft
  - Weather data from Open-Meteo Archive API

## Recent Changes
- Fixed search input width issue:
  - Added width: 100% to search-input-container
  - Added box-sizing: border-box to input elements
  - Ensured search input doesn't overflow its container
- Improved LanguageSwitcher mobile styling:
  - Updated to match the styling of month and year inputs
  - Added right-aligned labels with fixed width
  - Set consistent width calculation for select elements
  - Ensured consistent styling across all form controls

## Additional Notes
- The language preference is saved to localStorage
- Night temperatures are calculated by filtering hourly data for hours between 22:00 and 05:00
- Search now uses a fallback mechanism when the primary search returns no results
- All form controls now have consistent styling on mobile devices
- All inputs use box-sizing: border-box to prevent overflow issues
- Popup styling uses global CSS with the :global() selector to target Leaflet-generated elements
- Month and year preferences are stored in cookies with a 365-day expiration
- Cookie values are validated on retrieval to ensure they're within valid ranges
- Weather emojis are dynamically selected based on temperature ranges and weather conditions
- Emoji selection logic is contained in the getWeatherEmojis function
- Emojis are positioned to the left of their corresponding data values
- Popup layout uses flexbox for two-column alignment of labels and values
- Text labels have been shortened in both languages for better space efficiency
- Precipitation section uses a 60/40 column split to accommodate longer text
- Left padding has been reduced to 0.5rem for more compact display
- Lato font is loaded from Google Fonts with multiple weights (300, 400, 700, 900) and styles (normal, italic)
- Font weights are used consistently: semi-bold (600) for labels, regular (400) for content, bold (700) for important data
- Popup width has been increased from 300px to 350px with a minimum width of 320px
